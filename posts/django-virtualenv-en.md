Here's what you need to configure a **Django** project using **virtualenv**.<br>
- **pip**
- **virtualenv** (**Python** >= 3.5)
- **Django** >= 2.0

---

## 0) Why virtualenv?
There are people who say that **"Django works fine, Even if you are not using virtual environments"**

Let's assume the situation.

**Without a virtual environment**, you're installing and using pip modules.<br>
At that time, you installed the latest version of **Django 1.11**, using a new feature called **A**.<br>
A few years later, as **Django 2.2** becomes available and new features are added, the previously used feature **A** is no longer available.<br>
You want to use **Django 2.2** in a new project, so you upgrade Django 1.1, which was previously installed **without a virtual environment, to 2.2**.<br>
At that very moment, the **A** feature you were using in a project that was being deployed in Django 1.11 would not work.

If you use a virtual environment, you can use **multiple versions** of python on the **same host** at the same time,<br>
Therefore, you can use **multiple versions** of Django at the same time.<br>

Now, let's start a Django project with virtualenv!

---

## 1) Install pip
Follow the command below to install pip.

```python
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

---

## 2) Install virtualenv
If you have pip installed, this time you will install **virtualenv** using pip.

```python
pip install virtualenv
```

---

## 3) Create virtualenv
```python
virtualenv -p python3 venv_for_django
```

If you do not use the -p option, it is recommended to specify the version, since virtualenv can be created based on python2.Â

---

## 4) Activate virtualenv
```python
source venv_for_django/bin/activate
```

---

## 5) Check python version
Make sure that the virtualenv we created is based on python3 as intended.

```python
python --version
```

To use **Django** 2.0 or later, you must have a version of **python3** installed in virtualenv.<br>
So, when you create virtualenv, put the **-p python3** option.

If you do not include this option and you install a version of python2, **a lower version of Django (1.11) will be installed.**

---

## 6) Install Django
Install Django using pip.
```python
pip install django
```

---

## 7) Create Django project
In the virtualenv environment whrer Django is installed, enter the following command.
```python
django-admin startproject myproject
```

If the project name appears to be invalid as shown in the screenshot below, try a different project name.

---

## 8) Start Django project
Let's go into the generated project and run **python manage.py runserver** with **ip** and **port** options in the basic command.<br>
(I entered ip with 0.0.0.0 for external connection and entered port number 8000.)
```python
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
You will see a warning about **migrate** as shown in the screenshot below, but you can ignore it right now.<br>
We'll talk about **makemigrations** and **migrate** later.

---

## 9) ALLOWED_HOSTS
If you connect to host ip through port 8000 through web browser, you can see the debug screen with error **DisallowedHost at /**.

Since we do not have an ip on the **ALLOWED_HOSTS** list, we need to add 192.168.0.3, the ip we will connect to.<br>
The ALLOWED_HOSTS setting exists in **myproject/settings.py**.

Enter **'*'** in **ALLOWED_HOSTS** to allow access even if the host's address (ip, domain) changes.

## 10) Result
After the modification, run the **runserver** command again and you will see that the **Django** server is running normally.
